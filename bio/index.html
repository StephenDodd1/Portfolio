    <h3>Hi, I'm Stephen. I'm a Full-stack<br>
        Developer and STEAM enthusiast.
    </h3>
    <p>&emsp;I am a Thinkful Full-stack Flex 
        Program graduate. I enjoy a good 
        challenge. My passion is creating 
        interactive, exciting webpages, that 
        run seamlessly. I have been building 
        apps in JavaScript, Java and Python 
        for many years. I have hosted a few 
        websites, the most recent being for 
        my non-profit organization, 
        Mathemagical.org. I want to be an 
        artist to the gallery that is the web.
        <br><br>

        I have taught Secondary Mathematics in 
        Title 1 schools for the past 5 years. 
        In that time, I’ve had the pleasure of 
        teaching everything from 7th grade 
        mathematics to Second-year Advanced 
        Placement Calculus. I enjoy my job, 
        and I love the difference I make in 
        the lives of children. However, I am 
        ready to pursue my passion for content 
        development.
        <br><br>

        I have been studying for most of my 
        life. I am passionate about learning. 
        I enjoy self-improvement immensely. 
        In my free-time, I enjoy reading, 
        watching, thinking about Science and 
        Technology, and realistic Science-
        fiction, watching news, day-trading 
        stocks and general tinkering. Some of 
        my past projects have included 
        hydroponic gardening, building an open-
        source 3-d printer, building PC’s, and 
        of course, building apps and websites. 
        I enjoy inspiring others to set goals 
        and helping them reach those goals. I 
        love to learn.
